                    <p>Before I came to Austin High, I was in the magnet program at Kealing Middle School. Having such a small community surrounding me was an experience I wanted to have again, and that was what drew me to the Academy for Global Studies.</p>
                    <p>My mom's side moved frequently, from Guam to Virginia to Belgium. She's half Filipino and half Puerto Rican, and as a result grew up steeped in multiculturalism. My dad's side is 100% Scottish immigrants, but still traveled all over North America, from Florida to Nova Scotia. We travel to many places both inside and outside the US for vacations, and I also really looked forward to traveling for school when I applied for AGS. The experiences I have had at the Heifer International Ranch and Costa Rica have been very interesting and informative, and I believe that AGS has exposed me to a great deal of things that I would not have otherwise seen.</p>

                    <p>When I was a freshman, the 80 hour service requirement seemed an impossible goal. Since then, I've found organizations to volunteer with that I have greatly enjoyed doing so with. Three of my summers in high school I spent volunteering at an Austin Public Library branch for 4+ hours a week. They tend to be understaffed, and since I spent so much time at them when I was younger I decided to give back to them.</p>
                    <p>Volunteering with TreeFolks introduced me to just how important sustainability is, and I've spent several weekends planting saplings and tree cuttings along the greenbelt or in city parks.</p>
                    <p>The Goodwill GreenWorks program allowed me to take something I'm already good at and use it to give back to the community. I would help repair computers donated to Goodwill, and prepare them for resale at low prices. Unfortunately, the program has since been discontinued.</p>
                    <p>Through community service, I have gained an appreciation for all that I have. I plan to continue volunteering throughout the rest of my life and give back to the society that has served me for the past 18 years.</p>
