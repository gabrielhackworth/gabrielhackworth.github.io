                    <p>Every senior in AGS that plans to graduate is required to complete a Capstone project. We were given a semester to research a topic, as well as plan and carry out an action project designed to help alleviate the issue in the Austin area. As I mentioned in my Heifer reflection, hunger is sort of a personal issue, so I really wanted to do something to help people in Austin. My group felt the same, and we worked with the Capitol Area Food Bank of Texas to get more information, as well as work to set up volunteer dates to bring students to help in their food packaging center.</p>
                    <p>In our research, we determined that the best way to help in the Austin area would be to donate man-hours to the CAFB, to help them get food out to people in need faster. They can buy things in bulk really cheap, so donating food would not be nearlyl as effective. Donating money would be better, but we found that the bottleneck in their system was their understaffed packing center. We are still planning several volunteer dates in coordination with the CAFB, however recently my group found an opportunity that would have a greater direct impact on people's lives.</p>
                    <p>We recently found out that the AISD was planning to simply throw away roughly 400 ASUS EeePC netbooks. Coordinating with Cherry Whipple, we are working to repair them and set up a system that would allow students in need to check out a device for home use if they do not have one. As the internet has uses in nearly every field nowadays, we saw the impact that potentially helping up to 400 students would bring. Tech literacy is critical to everything from getting a job to keeping one, and we wanted to help our peers have as equal of opportunities as possible without the availability of computers being a factor.</p>

                    <p>TGPLAN stands for Think Globally, Plan Locally, Act Neighborly. The project was to take an issue that affects people around the world, and then work to help solve it in Austin and the surrounding area. Like I mentioned before, hunger as an issue hits a bit close to home, so I was immediately drawn to it. My group created an interactive tool that allows people to easily find food pantries and charities nearby in only a few clicks. We produced a measurable impact after deployment, with nearly a few hundred uses only weeks later.</p>
