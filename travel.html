                    <p>My freshman year, we traveled to the Heifer International Ranch near Little Rock, Arkansas. Heifer is a charity that promotes sustainable agriculture and is working to end hunger and poverty globally. The ranch is an "educational" farm, and while we were there we had to work with the limited resources we recieved as part of a simulation of poverty in various countries.</p>
                    <p>This trip really opened my eyes to just how much I take for granted. Hearing about how much food and resources are wasted really hit close to home becasue my abuelo grew up in abject poverty in the Philippines. The experiences of sleeping outside and eating nothing but charred potatoes and rice have stuck with me ever since. The trip and the knowledge I gained were the inspiration for my original capstone project.</p>
                    <p>Although the Heifer Ranch was the most memorable aspect of the trip, it wasn't the only thing we did. We toured a Heifer building, and got to see how it was designed to be environmentally friendly. We also toured the Arkansas State Capitol (which <strong>isn't</strong> the tallest in the US - sorry Ms. Docent, that's Texas), and took a trip to the Clinton Presidential Center. One of the coolest things we did was visit the Little Rock Central High School. Seeing such a historic building brought it to life in a way that photos can't. I would have in fact attended the exact same school if my parents hadn't moved to Austin when I was four.</p>
                    <p>The tirp to ARkansas and most notably the Heifer Ranch really openede my eyes to how extreme the issue of hunger is worldwide. It set the bar very high for the future AGS trips.</p>

                    <p>I had never been to Latin America before, so I was really anticipating the trip in the weeks leading up to it. I had no idea what to expect, and Costa Rica was unlike anywhere else I had been. I wasn't sure what to expect food-wise, but the staple foods of rice and beans were unsurprising, seeing as they're just as common in Puerto Rican cuisine. Seeing the cloud forest (where the rainforest is high enough and the clouds low enough that they touch the ground like fog) was a surreal experience, because I had never seen anything like it before.</p>
                    <p>For a few days we stayed at Earth University, a private university in Guanacaste devoted to agricultural science. We learned about sustainable agriculture and the necessity of reducing trash output as a society. We also built planters and learned about growing crops in small spaces. The university itself is located in the middle of banana farms, and wealso got to tour the banana processing plant (the same bananas Whole Food gets).</p>
                    <p>Visiting a finca (a ranch) near Earth University was also very interesting, as we not only got to see how people in Costa Rica lived and worked, but also got to taste foods like fresh coconut and sugar cane. We ate lunch prepared by the family and got to know them a little bit. I liked the personal aspect of it. What I didn't like was the commercialization that seemed to have occured. There was a gift shop next to or in one of the fincas, and when we visited the Bribri tribe there were definitely several of them that only used it as an opportunity to hawk gourds and other trinkets. That sort of thing did detract from the experience, and made it seem like the more personal bits were only bait to get us to buy stuff from them.</p>
                    <p>We also tured a nature preserve, and got to see the more exotic species of plants and animals in Costa Rica. In the photo album to the right, there is a photo of this bizarre spiked tree that we learned about while we were there.</p>
                    <p>Going to Costa Rica was an awesome experience for me. One of the coolest things we did was simply walk around San Jose the last day that we were there. We visited a cathedra, which was amazing to see the similarities and differences. We also got to just wander around a market and interact with the sellers. Now that I know what Costa Rica is like, I definitely plan to go back (except with a bit more Spanish under my belt - I took Chinese!).</p>

                    <p>The trip to Washington, DC was unlike any of the prior AGS trips. The biggest change was the part of the trip centered around a project. The assignment was to design and propose a monument to one or more people. My group proposed a memorial clinic to victims of acid throwing attacks, as reparative surgeries are intensive and expensive. We presented to a represntative for the Wilson Center, a government think-tank for global research and problem solving. Due to the fact that every group was presenting a different topic to a different person, we got a massive amount of freedom and time to get lunch and enjoy our downtime. We took public transportation the entire trip, which is normal for me, but it was amusing to see the reactions of my peers that had never set foot in a bus before.</p>
                    <p>While we were in DC, we stayed at the 4H Youth Center, which is conference center for youth groups. Our activities were coordinated by Amizade, and the main focus of the trip was the issue of homelessness. I already felt like I had a pretty good grasp on the issue and it's causes, but I learned even more on the trip. One night we all met at a church and listened to several speakers that had been homeless before. The first was a doctor, making six figures before she developed a chronic illness that cost her both house and job. With medical bills piling up, she was forced out of her home financially. Her story caught me by surprise, because of how drastic of a turn her life had taken. I knew that most homeless people became homeless due to circumstances outside of their control, but the severity of her loss shocked me. The man that spoke after her talked about losing his family and house after becoming addicted to crack during a low point in his life. Again, the fact that this family man lost his family greatly shocked me, and made me realize that <strong>anybody</strong> can potentially become homeless.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to Amizade, we were set up to volunteer with several organizations founded to combat homelessness. A large portion of the class volunteered at a charity helping people find jobs and get back on their feet. My group also volunteered at the Central Union Mission. It's a men's shelter that also provides things like doctors and dentists - things that homeless people would not usually have access to otherwise. With all of our talks centering around homelessness and how serious it is in DC, it was really nice to work with organizations that try to combat it.</p>
                    <p>Since DC is the capital after all, we were also able to take advantage of the entertainment. We toured the national mall, and got to see all of the monuments. We also were allowed to split up and go to whichever part of the Smithsonian we liked, which was amazing.</p>
                    <p>Although the DC trip was different than any of the others with the freedom we were given and the project aspect, the service component and focus on helping people still made it clearly an AGS trip, and one that I greatly enjoyed at that.</p>
